# Garbage-Classification
Waste image classification using deep learning (ANN &amp; CNN).

## Project Overview
This project develops an automated waste classification system using Deep Learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are applied to classify garbage images into predefined categories, aiming to improve accuracy and support more efficient waste sorting.

## Tools used and Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (deep learning model development)
- scikit-learn (train–test data splitting)
- OpenCV (image processing)
- pandas & numpy (data handling and numerical operations)
- matplotlib & seaborn (data visualization)

## Techniques
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Data shuffling and splitting
- Deep learning training with callbacks (Early Stopping)
- Transfer learning preprocessing (MobileNetV2)
